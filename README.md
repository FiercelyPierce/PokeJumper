# Overview

This is a simple little game that has you run around the screen, jumping to avoid the enemies that assail you.

I used this to practice with pygame so I could understand it further and become familiar with it. I will be looking into other liberaries, but I decided to start with pygame since I knew of a couple of resourses already.
